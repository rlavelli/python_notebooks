# Collection of Python Notebooks

Here I save all my iPython notebooks. The reference to the data used is in the title of each file and inside the notebook itself.

I mostly focus on Data Vizualisation and Exploratory Analysis in general.

Each analysis is updated whenever I have the chance or some insight and/or some new tecnique that I wanto to explore, by all means it's not complete.
